	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		Chicken lollipop is a popular appetizer known for its crisp texture and tangy-spicy flavor. To prepare it, start
		by marinating chicken wings. First, "French" the chicken wings by scraping the meat down toward one end to form
		a lollipop shape. Marinate the cleaned wings in a mixture of ginger-garlic paste, soy sauce, red chili powder,
		turmeric, and a pinch of salt. Let the marinade rest for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.
		Prepare a batter by mixing all-purpose flour, cornflour, egg, a dash of soy sauce, and water until smooth. Coat
		the marinated chicken in the batter and deep-fry it in hot oil until golden brown and crispy.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the final touch, toss the fried chicken in a quick sauce. Heat some oil in a wok, saut√© minced garlic, and
		add soy sauce, chili sauce, ketchup, and a pinch of sugar for a balanced flavor. Adjust the consistency with a
		splash of water and let the sauce simmer briefly. Toss the fried lollipops in the sauce until well-coated.
		Garnish with finely chopped spring onions and serve hot with a side of spicy dipping sauce or a fresh salad.
		This dish is perfect for parties or as a flavorful evening snack.
