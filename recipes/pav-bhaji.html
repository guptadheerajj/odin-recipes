	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		Pav Bhaji is a popular Indian street food made from mashed vegetables cooked in a spiced tomato-based gravy,
		served with buttered pav (bread rolls). The vegetables typically used include potatoes, peas, carrots, and bell
		peppers, which are boiled and mashed together. The spicy gravy is made using onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic,
		and a special pav bhaji masala, creating a flavorful dish that is both comforting and satisfying.
